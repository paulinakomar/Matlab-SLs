Simulation takes into account 1/2 uc instead 1/4 uc, therefore one does not grow TiSn layer on top of HfSn - this is probably forbidden from the chemical point of view. Ni layers should be always sandwiched between TiSn (HfSn) layers.

one can simply go back to the previous verion of the program changing the parameter divide_uc and handles.divide_uc in files: SL_gui.m and SL_buffer_input.m
